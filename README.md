# Supplementary Material for "Faster Coherent Quantum Algorithms for Phase, Energy, and Amplitude
Estimation"

By Patrick Rall.

This repository contains code for benchmarking the algorithms presented in [arXiv:2207.08628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08628). It was used to generate the figures in the paper.

The entire implementation is in the [phase_estimation_performance.ipynb](phase_estimation_performance.ipynb) jupyter notebook.
